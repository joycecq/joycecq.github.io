Hi, I am Qian Chen ( 陈倩 )！
==
- I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) (HKU) working with Prof. [Kaibin Huang](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~huangkb/) and Prof. [Xianhao Chen](http://xianhaochen.net/).
- Before HKU, I received my B.E. and Ph.D. degree in Information and Communication Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) (HIT), Harbin, China, in 2018 and 2023, respectively. During the doctoral program, I was supervised by Prof. [Weixiao Meng](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/mengweixiao). 
- I was a visiting student with the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD), [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://sutd.edu.sg/) (SUTD), Singapore, from December 2021 to December 2022, supervised by Prof. [Tony Q. S. Quek](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~tonyquek/).
- I was the student chair of IEEE ComSoc Harbin Chapter from 2017 to 2023.
- During my doctoral studies, my primary research are performance analysis and resource allocation in space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN).
- Currently, my research focus on the **edge intelligence in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks**.
- I am also very interested in financial knowledge and have self-studied to pass all required subjects of the National Uniform **Certified Public Accountant (CPA)** Examination of P.R. China.
