- I am a postdoctoral fellow at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) (HKU) working with Prof. [Kaibin Huang](https://www.eee.hku.hk/people/huangkb/) and Prof. [Xianhao Chen](http://xianhaochen.net/).
- Before HKU, I received my B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in Information and Communication Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) (HIT), Harbin, China, in 2018 and 2023, respectively. During the doctoral program, I was supervised by Prof. [Weixiao Meng](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/mengweixiao).
- I was a visiting student with the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) Pillar, [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://sutd.edu.sg/) (SUTD), Singapore, from December 2021 to December 2022, supervised by Prof. [Tony Q.S. Quek](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~tonyquek/). I was also a visiting postdoctoral fellow at [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) in 2025, working with Prof. [Dongzhu Liu](https://dongzhuliu.github.io/).
- I have self-studied to pass all required subjects of the [National Uniform Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Examination of P.R. China](http://www.lncpa.org.cn/lnas/content/detail/1714400051118) and I am a CPA holder.
- If you are willing to collaborate with me, please feel free to email me (qcheneee[AT]hku.hk / qian.chen[AT]ieee.org).
